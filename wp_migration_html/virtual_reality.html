        <p>Matterport enables anyone to digitally reconstruct real-world spaces for use in VR, AR, web, and mobile applications with ease. Our technology lets you offer clients one-of-a-kind, immersive experiences that give viewers a realistic sense of actually being there.</p>
        <p>With the launch of the <b>VR Showcase Beta</b>, our customers can now convert their Spaces for use on <a href="http://www.samsung.com/global/microsite/gearvr/">Samsung Gear VR</a> for consumers everywhere to experience.</p>

        <h2>Join the Matterport VR Beta</h2>
        <p>Matterport is currently beta testing a new service that lets you view your Matterport Showcases on virtual reality headsets. The goal is to turn the interior view of Showcase into an immersive virtual reality experience.</p>
        <p>The video below shows the images seen by each eye during interactive exploration, but you need a Gear VR to truly experience the feeling of immersion.</p>

        <p>You can already experience publicly available Matterport models on Gear VR by downloading the Matterport VR Showcase app, available now in the Samsung Gear VR app store. This app features a carousel of Matterport spaces, including an art gallery, a national park, and a World Heritage Site.</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Matterport VR Showcase is currently available for the </span><span style="color: #1ba6df;"><a style="color: #1ba6df;" href="http://www.samsung.com/us/explore/gear-vr/?cid=ppc-"><span style="font-weight: 800;">Samsung Gear VR</span></a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ($99.99, works with the Samsung Note 5, Samsung Galaxy S6, S6 Edge, S6 Edge+,  Galaxy S7, and the S7 Edge).</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are also working to bring the Matterport VR Showcase app to additional Android devices via Google Cardboard in the future. However, since Google Cardboard is an open platform, performance on any particular device is harder to guarantee. In general, newer phones should be used for the best experience. Older phones (launched more than a year ago) may not be supported, or may suffer low frame rate, latency, or other issues.</span></p>
        <p><b>Your Content in VR</b></p>
        <p>We’re inviting Matterport camera owners to get in early on the experience of viewing their Matterport spaces in VR with our VR Beta program, in advance of our mainstream VR app. Participants will also have a chance to give us feedback as we build out the main VR app experience.</p>
        <p>At this time, we have limited capacity, so there is a moderate per-model conversion fee for the program. This also covers the cost of manual post-processing to ensure models look their best in VR. Conversion time can be up to two calendar weeks, though we expect turnaround times to drop as we move to a more automated system.</p>
        <p>Results will vary based on model quality. Depending on the model data quality, we may choose to turn off stereo in the VR version. This means that distances will “pop” less, but provides a cleaner visual experience and is less likely to cause motion sickness. Models submitted to the VR Beta program should generally have 75 active scan positions (sweeps) or fewer. You can, and often should, thin out scan positions to reduce clutter by selectively removing them from high-density areas in Workshop. A 100-sweep model may look stellar as a 70-sweep model in VR.</p>
        <p>If you’re interested in converting a Matterport space into VR, we’re happy to provide feedback on how well it will work. Please contact us by filling out the form below for more details.</p>
        <p class="vr-lg">Preparing your models for VR:</p>
        <p>VR is different from the standard 3D Showcase experience, so you’ll want to capture and edit your scans a little differently. Follow the guidelines below to optimize the experience of your Matterport model in VR.</p>
        <p><b>Scanning for VR:</b></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Ensure that the tripod is kept at a consistent height near eye level, and choose scan positions carefully based on where it would feel natural to stand.</li>
          <li>It still pays to scan densely to improve the quality of your mesh, but keep in mind that final scan positions should be consistently spaced to produce a natural feeling of movement. You can always deactivate extra positions in Workshop.</li>
          <li>Avoid putting the camera too close to walls where possible. These placements may make users feel claustrophobic in VR.</li>
          <li>Cover large spaces in a grid pattern with consistent distances between scan positions.</li>
          <li>Ensure windows and mirrors are properly marked. Models with improperly or unmarked windows and mirrors will not look as good, especially in Stereo mode.</li>
          <li>Try to capture complete rooms. If capturing open areas or parts of rooms, scan farther than you want users to walk, and then deactivate sweeps beyond your desired boundary so that the mesh extends well beyond the outermost active sweep.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>Editing for VR:</b></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Duplicate your model when editing for VR. You’ll likely make different choices for viewing on the web versus viewing in VR. If you want to convert an existing model to VR and it’s no longer on your iPad, a Matterport representative can duplicate it for you.</li>
          <li>When you view your model in VR, each scan position will be represented by a sphere. These spheres will be at eye level. Use Workshop to reduce the density of sweeps, generally only having one every ~10 feet, for a less cluttered experience.</li>
          <li>In densely captured areas, deactivate some scan positions to thin out the view and allow the user to move at a natural pace.</li>
          <li>Ensure that there is a scan position visible in front of each doorway so that it’s easy to move through the doorway.</li>
          <li>If you did any additional sweeps at very high or low positions, you’ll want to remove these to create a path composed of consistent capture heights. In Workshop you can switch modes to view sweep heights.  This will let you more easily choose which sweeps to deactivate and get a sense of overall sweep density.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In order to view your converted model in VR, you will need to download and install the “Matterport VR Showcase” app from the Oculus VR app store. It can be found under the “Apps” tab in the store. This is a large app, and we recommend downloading over Wifi when possible.</p>

      <p>The Samsung GearVR is now available to consumers for $99, and it has already been widely adopted by consumers and businesses. Matterport customers were some of the first content creators for the platform.</p>
      <p>In 2016, we plan to make any Matterport Space available in virtual reality, at the push of a button, making Matterport the first end-to-end immersive media platform for VR content creation.</p>
